# Switch5 

I created this project because of my fascination with one of the biggest trends in basketball. I feel like every time the NBA playoffs come around, the discourse becomes centered around each team's closing lineup and whether or not they can switch 1 through 5. Most of the time, the question is whether or not the center can switch onto perimeter players. Hence, the "switch 5".

I divided my research up into three sections. Each section will contain a write-up, along with the code and datasets I used.

## Part 1: Trends in the Tracking Era

Coming soon. Very soon.

## Part 2: Statistical Traits of Small Lineups

Coming soon.

## Part 3: Strategic Implications

In the works.
